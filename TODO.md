# TODO

## Dev Stage 1

- [x] Setup Discord API

- [ ] Test out changedetection.io

- [ ] Create rudimentary automatic Target purchaser

	- Make a minimally viable product (no bells and whistles)

- [ ] Redraw architecture

## Non-live testing

- [ ] Test pipeline without money

## Dev Stage 2

- [ ] Fix any errors from non-live testing

- [ ] Refine UI

## Live testing

- [ ] Send Discord message to bot endpoint

- [ ] Go to actual Target site

## Stage 3 (scaling up)

To bypass any rate/order limits, we can use the following strategies as workarounds:

	- [ ] Multiple addresses

	- [ ] Multiple Gift-cards instead of a single CC

## Stage 4 (frontend interface)

- [ ] Add privately available React UI for tracking bot

- [ ] Current status (buying / waiting / banned)

- [ ] Purchase history

- [ ] Log readouts
